INPUT VALIDATION (VERY IMPORTANT)
===========================================================

Before generating the report, first evaluate whether the startup information is meaningful.

If any of the following are true:

- The startup description is random or meaningless.
- The startup contains placeholder text like:
  "asdf", "abc", "xyz", "test", "qwerty", "demo", "sample".
- The problem statement is unclear.
- The solution is missing or too vague.
- The target audience is missing.
- The information is insufficient to perform reliable analysis.

DO NOT invent competitors.
DO NOT invent SWOT.
DO NOT invent recommendations.
DO NOT guess.

Instead return EXACTLY this JSON:

{
  "status": "invalid",
  "reason": "The provided startup information is insufficient for a reliable AI analysis.",
  "missing": [
    "Problem Statement",
    "Solution",
    "Target Audience"
  ]
}
